}
```

#### Database Configuration
```lua
Config.Database = {
    UseOxmysql = true,
    Debug = true,
    SlowQueryWarning = 500,
    PostgreSQL = {
        Enabled = false,
        ConnectionString = "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
    }
}
```

#### Logging Options
```lua
Config.Logging = {

    },
    FileManager = {
        Enabled = true,
        Path = "logs/"
    }
}
```

#### Inventory Systems

## API Reference

LUXCore exposes several powerful APIs to interact with the core systems dynamically.

### Framework Utilities
```lua
-- Detect Framework
local framework, object = LUX.Framework.Detect()

-- Get Player Data
local playerData = LUX.Framework.GetPlayerData(playerId)

-- Register Commands
LUX.Framework.RegisterCommand('exampleCommand', function(source, args)
    print('Command executed!')
end)
```

### Database Utilities
```lua
-- Execute Queries
LUX.Database.Execute("SELECT * FROM players WHERE id = ?", {playerId}, function(results)
    print(results)
end)
```

### Inventory Utilities
```lua
-- Get Inventory
local inventory = LUX.Inventory.GetInventory(playerId)

-- Add Items
LUX.Inventory.AddItem(playerId, 'bread', 5)
```

### Custom Events

-- Register Player Loaded Event
LUX.Events.RegisterPlayerLoaded(function(playerId)
    print("Player Loaded: " .. playerId)
end)
```
